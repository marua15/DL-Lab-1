# Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains two deep learning projects focusing on regression and multi-class classification tasks. Below is an overview of each part:

## PART ONE: Regression

In this part, you'll find the implementation of a deep learning project aimed at predicting stock prices. The project utilizes PyTorch to build a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model and integrates GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization. The provided code includes modules for:

- Loading and preprocessing data (the dataset used: [NYSE Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse))
- Constructing and training the model
- Tuning hyperparameters
- Evaluating and visualizing results

## PART TWO: Multi-Class Classification

This section addresses a comprehensive deep learning task involving a dataset containing information on a manufacturing process. The project covers various aspects of deep learning and neural network development. It includes:

- Thorough data preprocessing, including cleaning and standardization/normalization
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand dataset characteristics
- Data augmentation techniques to handle class imbalance
- Building a deep neural network architecture using PyTorch for multi-class classification
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV from scikit-learn
- Visualizations of loss and accuracy over epochs for performance analysis
- Calculation of essential metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score) for training and test datasets
- Introduction of regularization techniques (L1 and L2 regularization) to the neural network architecture

The comprehensive approach provides insights into the dataset, effective model development, and rigorous evaluation techniques.

**Dataset Used:** [Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification)

## Conclusion

Throughout these projects, valuable insights and skills have been acquired, including:

- Proficiency in PyTorch: Extensive work with PyTorch has deepened understanding of neural network architectures and enhanced the ability to implement them effectively. PyTorch's flexibility and user-friendly interface have been instrumental in achieving project goals.
